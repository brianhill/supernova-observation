## Target Selection and Observation Planning Links

1. Supernovae identified by the [Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu) are within our grasp. Supernovae light curves taken over many nights with our gear will be of sufficient interest to astrophysics researchers that we can contribute our results to refereed publications. Supernovae have various brightnesses with the brightest ones having peak luminosity brighter than magnitude 17 (see the Rochester Astronomy of Science's compendium of [Latest Supernovae](https://www.rochesterastronomy.org/supernova.html)).
2. For accessing photos of the target region, [select DSS2 Red](https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/current/cgi/query.pl)
