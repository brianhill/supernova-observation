## ZTF24aahgqwk Analysis

After the intermittenly bad weather of February and early March eased off, a promising supernova in NGC 3443 was identified by the ZTF.

Our [ZTF24aahgqwk Analysis](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/index.html) summarizes 18 nights of data-taking for this supernova from late March to early May.
