# Supernova Observation

*A program of directed study and research aimed at pushing the limits of the Deep Springs Observatory and observing supernovae.*

Spring Semester 2024, Deep Springs College

Mentor/Supervisor: [Prof. Brian Hill](../index.html)

Student Researchers: Hexi Jin (DS 23) and Ethan Liao (DS 22)

## Syllabus and Notes

* [Syllabus](./syllabus.html)

## Record of Work

* [Record of Work - Term 4](./record_of_work-term_4.html)
* Record of Work - Term 5 &mdash; See our [ZTF24aahgqwk Observation Log](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/ZTF24aahgqwk-observation_log.html)
* Record of Work - Term 6 &mdash; See our [ZTF24aahgqwk Analysis](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/index.html) and our completed passovers below

## Video Passovers

We have converted the written passovers inherited from the [prior spring's team](../transient-astronomy/index.html) into five videos:

* [Field Setup of the College Telescope] (https://youtu.be/EfwUompp8xY)
* [Polar Alignment of the Losmandy Mount](https://youtu.be/vgO31NmwcmA)
* [Setting up Mount and OTA in the Dome](https://youtu.be/sCsEXKleVPs)
* [Opening and Closing the Dome and Control Room](https://youtu.be/UROLhHAeSec)
* [Operating the Losmandy Hand Controller - FORTHCOMING](https://www.google.com)

Usually the mount and OTA (optical tube assembly) are already set up in the dome, and you can skip straight to the fourth and fifth videos to get observing.
 
## ZTF24aahgqwk Analysis

After the intermittenly bad weather of February and early March eased off, a promising supernova in NGC 3443 was identified by the ZTF.

Our [ZTF24aahgqwk Analysis](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/index.html) summarizes 18 nights of data-taking for this supernova from late March to early May.
