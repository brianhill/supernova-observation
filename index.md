# Supernova Observation

## Syllabus

* [Syllabus](./syllabus.html)

## Target Selection Links

1. Supernovae identified by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) are within our grasp. Supernovae have various brightnesses with the brightest ones having peak luminosity brighter than magnitude 17. A pre-digested list of supernovae is the Rochester Astronomy of Science's [compendium](https://www.rochesterastronomy.org/supernova.html).
2. However, generally, we don't want to wait for a candidate to appear in a compendium, so we use the [ALeRCE search tool for ZTF candidates](https://alerce.online/?selectedClassifier=stamp_classifier&selectedClass=SN&probability=0.65&ndet=1&ndet=3157&ranking=1&firstmjd=60378&count=false&page=1&perPage=20)
3. Or sometimes another ALeRCE tool, [Supernovae Hunter search](https://snhunter.alerce.online)
4. One more place to hunt for candidates is the [IAU Transient Name Server](https://www.wis-tns.org/search) because it gets candidates from sources, such as the ATLAS collaboration

##  Random Notes

1. LEDA identifiers are often the same as PGC identifiers
2. For accessing photos of the target region, [select DSS2 Red](https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/current/cgi/query.pl)

## Week of March 18 Work Plan

* Work on internet at Henderson (fixed)
* Work on internet at seismic (fixed)
* Collimation (did everything but back-focus)
* Get the video work with the Celestron done
* March 19 (UTC) observe [./analyses/ZTF24aagupsf/index.html](./analyses/ZTF24aagupsf/index.html) in PGC 58391, too dim
* March 20 (UTC) observe [./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/index.html](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/index.html) in NGC 3443, very promising
* March 21 continue NGC 3443 if weather cooperates and take calibration images for March 20 data
* March 22 analyze March 20 data
* Make mini-desk for laptop in dome
* Install 24&rdquo; monitor, 2.4GHz mouse, and keyboard
