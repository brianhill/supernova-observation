# Supernova Observation

## Syllabus

* [Syllabus](./syllabus.html)

## Target Selection Links

1. Supernovae identified by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) are within our grasp. Supernovae have various brightnesses with the brightest ones having peak luminosity brighter than magnitude 17. A pre-digested list of supernovae is the Rochester Astronomy of Science's [compendium](https://www.rochesterastronomy.org/supernova.html).
2. However, generally, we don't want to wait for a candidate to appear in a compendium, so we use the [ALeRCE search tool for ZTF candidates](https://alerce.online/?selectedClassifier=stamp_classifier&selectedClass=SN&probability=0.65&ndet=1&ndet=3157&ranking=1&firstmjd=60378&count=false&page=1&perPage=20)
3. Or sometimes another ALeRCE tool, [Supernovae Hunter search](https://snhunter.alerce.online)
4. One more place to hunt for candidates is the [IAU Transient Name Server](https://www.wis-tns.org/search) because it gets candidates from sources, such as the ATLAS collaboration

##  Random Notes

1. LEDA identifiers are often the same as PGC identifiers
2. For accessing photos of the target region, use [this resource](https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/current/cgi/query.pl) and select DSS2 Red

## Observation Log

### Week of March 18

* Work on internet at Henderson (successfully fixed)
* Work on internet at seismic (successfully fixed, and we have internet at the observatory again)
* Re-do collimation (did everything but back-focus)
* Get the video work with the Celestron done
* March 19 (UTC) observe [ZTF24aagupsf](./analyses/ZTF24aagupsf/index.html) in PGC 58391, too dim
* March 20 (UTC) try observing [SN ZTF24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/index.html), which is very promising
* March 20, observed and despite the waxing gibbous moon being nearby, it was so bright it was obvious, did 60 of 30-second r exposures, and then 60 of 30-second g exposures, all half-subframed and binned 3x3
* March 21 (UTC) continue observing [SN ZTF24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/index.html) despite weather barely cooperating
* March 21, was able to observe despite thin clouds forming -- the images were done 30 red, 30 green, 30 red, 30 green rather than the usual 60 red 60 green, because of concern that the clouds would prevent any of the later images from being taken, but in fact, most of the images are ok, except possibly near the end some are useless
* March 23 (UTC) continue observing [SN ZTF24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/index.html) despite bright moon
* March 23, 96% full moon is only 6&deg; from the target, but happily, the supernova is still bright enough to observe, we had to jog the telescope 5 arc-minutes to the left (5' increase in RA)

### Week of March 25

* March 25, pre-dawn, continue [SN ZTF24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/index.html) pre-dawn due to bad evening weather
* March 25 (pre-dawn), not a great observing session, *filter wheel in unknown position,* air turbulent, target down around 20&deg; and dropping, did 30, 30, 15, and 15, but it isn't known what positions the filter was in
* March 25 Make mini-desk for laptop in dome, and install monitor, 2.4GHz mouse, and keyboard
* March 26 Re-do cabling now with laptop on mini-desk in dome
* March 26 Re-do sky model, because the last two observing runs, the target has been observed to be 5 arcminutes displaced
* March 27 (last night before heading to NM with Jack, friend of Mac's) had to operate laptop from dome because keyboard didn't work
* March 27 (UTC) continue observing [SN ZTF24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/index.html), moon is now improving

### Week of April 1

* April 1 continue observing [SN ZTF24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/index.html)
* April 2 (with Hexi) windy and cold but clear after storm, again had to operate laptop from dome, scope temp at beginning about 8.0&deg; and focus was best about 5341, but it was tough to get a good read due to poor seeing
* April 2 continue observing [SN ZTF24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/index.html)
* April 3 (with Ethan) best night this spring, keyboard now working, scope temp at beginning about 12.5&deg; and focus was best about 5067
* April 3 continue observing [SN ZTF24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/index.html)
* April 4 (with Hexi) started early because forecast showed clouds late, some wind buffeting while focusing, scope temp at beginning about 14.8&deg; and focus was best about 5090, some images may be too wind-buffeted -- toss them -- there was a break in observing about 9:30pm local time (did we bump the keyboard?)
* April 5 continue observing [SN ZTF24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/index.html)

### Week of April 8

* April 8, sky model again
* April 9 continue observing [SN ZTF24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/index.html)
* April 10 continue observing [SN ZTF24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/index.html)
* April 11 continue observing [SN ZTF24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/index.html) and calibration images
* April 12 continue observing [SN ZTF24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/index.html)
