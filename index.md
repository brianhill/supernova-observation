## Target Selection and Observation Planning Links

1. Supernovae identified by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) are within our grasp. Supernovae have various brightnesses with the brightest ones having peak luminosity brighter than magnitude 17. A pre-digested list of supernovae is the Rochester Astronomy of Science's [compendium](https://www.rochesterastronomy.org/supernova.html). Generally, we don't want to wait for a candidate to appear there. So we use the [ALeRCE search](https://alerce.online/?selectedClassifier=stamp_classifier&selectedClass=SN&probability=0.23&ndet=1&ndet=3157&ranking=1&firstmjd=60355&count=false&page=1&perPage=20&sortBy=probability&sortDesc=true). ALeRCE [Supernovae Hunter search](https://snhunter.alerce.online). One more place to hunt for candidates is the [IAU Transient Name Server](https://www.wis-tns.org/search).
