(1) Turn on AC to monitor, PC, and 10m USB extension cable
(2) In the dome, remove telescope covers
(3) Then press button that boots the laptop
(4) Back in control room, log into laptop -- PIN is XXXX
(5) Turn on AC to telescope and wifi
(6) Allow some time for system to become quiescent
(7) Launch TheSkyX (the icon that says 64)
(8) Connect devices (using the various panels in TheSkyX app):
    (a) Connect mount (TheSkyX refers to the mount as the "telescope")
          ONLY HOME THE MOUNT IF YOU ARE CONFIDENT THERE ARE NO OBSTRUCTIONS
    (b) After mount becomes quiescent, connect camera
          and filter wheel should connect too, but check that it has
    (c) Connect focuser

If any of the devices fails to connect:

(9) Disconnect the devices (again using the various panels in TheSkyX app)
(10) Quit TheSkyX
(11) Turn off AC to telescope and wifi
(12) Go back to Step 5

You are ready for your observing session, which usually begins with test images or focusing.

The observing session procedure is beyond the scope of this document.

Some things you will be doing at the beginning of the observing session are homing the mount, if you didn't in step 8(a), and then slewing to the target, then taking a test photo using. Then focusing using @Focus3.

IT IS WORTH NOTING that frequently the very first image acquisition fails. Just abort and do another!
At the end of observing session:

(13) Disconnect focuser and then camera (again using the various panels in TheSkyX app)
(14) Park mount and then disconnect mount
(15) Quit TheSkyX
(16) Turn off AC to telescope and wifi
(17) Shutdown laptop
(16) Turn off AC to monitor, PC, and 10m USB extension cable
(18) Close laptop lid
(19) Cover telescope
