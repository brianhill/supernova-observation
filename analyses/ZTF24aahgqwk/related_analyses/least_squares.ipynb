    "We will be using least-squares minimization to fit the image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could write the code from scratch, but it is tricky to find the minimum of a function\n",
    "in a high-dimensional space, so it is better to use well-tested code. The scipy library\n",
    "has an algorithm for fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we want to do is learn to to use their algorithm. This might seem easy, but\n",
    "remember, that the data has to be passed in, the parameters have to be passed in, and the \n",
    "residuals have to be computed, and in order to do this completely generally, abstractions\n",
    "have to be introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, the least_squares function\n",
    "takes the function to be minimized as its first argument. It is easiest to see this in an example.\n",

    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of [scipy.optimize.least_squares](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.least_squares.html) give\n",
    "an example uing the [Rosenbrock function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function)\n",
    "which is considered a challenging test for least squares fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In their example, there is no data. Just two parameters are given, x\\[0\\] and x\\[1\\], and the\n",
    "function that the user supplies produces two residuals."
