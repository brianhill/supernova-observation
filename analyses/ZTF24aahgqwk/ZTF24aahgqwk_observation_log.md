### Week of 2024-03-19

* 2024-03-20 try observing [ZTF 24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/ZTF24aahgqwk_target_info/index.html), which is very promising
* 2024-03-21 observed and despite the waxing gibbous moon being nearby, it was so bright it was obvious, did 60 of 30-second r exposures, and then 60 of 30-second g exposures, all half-subframed and binned 3x3
* 2024-03-21 continue observing [ZTF 24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/ZTF24aahgqwk_target_info/index.html) despite weather barely cooperating
* 2024-03-22 (or is it more notes on 2024-03-21?), was able to observe despite thin clouds forming -- the images were done 30 red, 30 green, 30 red, 30 green rather than the usual 60 red 60 green, because of concern that the clouds would prevent any of the later images from being taken, but in fact, most of the images are ok, except possibly near the end some are useless
* 2024-03-23 continue observing [ZTF 24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/ZTF24aahgqwk_target_info/index.html) despite bright moon
* 2024-03-24 (or is it more notes on 2024-03-23?) 96% full moon is only 6&deg; from the target, but happily, the supernova is still bright enough to observe, we had to jog the telescope 5 arc-minutes to the left (5' increase in RA)

### Week of 2024-03-26

* 2023-03-25, pre-dawn, continue [ZTF 24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/ZTF24aahgqwk_target_info/index.html) pre-dawn due to bad evening weather
* 2023-03-25 (pre-dawn), not a great observing session, *filter wheel in unknown position,* air turbulent, target down around 20&deg; and dropping, did 30, 30, 15, and 15, but it isn't known what positions the filter was in
* 2023-03-26 (last night before heading to NM with Jack, friend of Mac's) had to operate laptop from dome because keyboard didn't work
* 2023-03-26 continue observing [ZTF 24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/ZTF24aahgqwk_target_info/index.html), moon is now improving

### Week of 2024-04-02

* 2024-04-02 continue observing [ZTF 24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/ZTF24aahgqwk_target_info/index.html)
* 2024-04-03 (with Hexi) windy and cold but clear after storm, again had to operate laptop from dome, scope temp at beginning about 8.0&deg; and focus was best about 5341, but it was tough to get a good read due to poor seeing
* 2024-04-03 continue observing [ZTF 24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/ZTF24aahgqwk_target_info/index.html)
* 2024-04-04 (with Ethan) best night this spring, keyboard now working, scope temp at beginning about 12.5&deg; and focus was best about 5067
* 2024-04-04 continue observing [ZTF 24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/ZTF24aahgqwk_target_info/index.html)
* 2024-04-05 (with Hexi) started early because forecast showed clouds late, some wind buffeting while focusing, scope temp at beginning about 14.8&deg; and focus was best about 5090, some images may be too wind-buffeted -- toss them -- there was a break in observing about 9:30pm local time (did we bump the keyboard?)
* 2024-04-06 continue observing [ZTF 24aahgqwk in NGC 3443](./analyses/ZTF24aahgqwk/ZTF24aahgqwk_target_info/index.html)
